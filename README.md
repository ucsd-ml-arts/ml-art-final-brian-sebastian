## Abstract Proposal

For the final project, I will be revisiting project 4. For project 4, I used DeepDream on a kaleidoscope video to create a short clip. For the final project I hope to create a longer video that can be looped to have a more hypnotic effect. I think that this would be interesting since I've noticed that the more I've watched the clip I've made, the more I've noticed subtle details. In addition, I also plan on experimenting more with using the different layers of the model to create different effects. In particular, I'd like to experiment with using different linear combinations of layers that change over time and see how they affect the video. For the final presentation, I will present the project as a video.
